# C Iterators

This repository contains an implementation of iterators in C. It mainly only
iterates over a single linked list but can be expanded to iterate over any
structure you think of.

## Compiling & Usage

Just take the entire **lib** directory and use it if you want just a simple
single linked list iterator. No fancy stuff heh? If you want to iterate over
another structure you will have to change some details on the implementation
itself as I haven't done anything more generic than a list iterator.
