# C Iterators
---

This repository contains an implementation of iterators in C. It mainly ony
iterates over a single linked list but can be expanded to iterate over any
structure you think of.

## Compiling & Usage
---

Just take the entire **include** directory and use it if you want just a simple
single linked list iterator. No fancy stuff heh? If you want to iterate over
another structure you will have to change some details on the implementation
itself as I didn't done nothing about making this a bit more generic.
